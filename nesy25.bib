	abstract = {Transformer models, despite their exceptional capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Vision tasks, like deep neural network models, often function as "black boxes" as their internal processes remain largely opaque due to their complex architectures. This work extends graph-based knowledge extraction techniques, previously applied to CNNs, to the domain of Transformer models.
The inner mechanics of Transformer models are explored by constructing a co-activation graph from their encoder layers. The nodes of the graph represent the hidden unit within each encoder layer, while the edges represent the statistical correlations between these hidden units. The magnitude of co-activation, which is the correlation between activations of two hidden units, determines the strength of their connection within the graph.
Our research is focused on encoder-only Transformer classifiers. We conducted experiments involving a custom-built Transformer and a pre-trained BERT model for an NLP task. We used graph analysis to detect semantically related class clusters and their impact on misclassification patterns. We demonstrate a positive correlation between class similarity and the frequency of classification errors.  Our findings suggest that co-activation graphs reveal structured, interpretable representations in Transformers, consistent with prior CNN findings on knowledge extraction.}

Explainability techniques (XAI) have made remarkable progress in the interpretability of ML models. However, the non-euclidean nature of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) makes it difficult to reuse already existing XAI methods. While other works have focused on instance-based explanation methods for GNNs, very few have investigated model-based methods and, to our knowledge, none have tried to probe the embedding of the GNNs for structural graph properties. In this paper we present a model agnostic explainability pipeline for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) employing diagnostic classifiers. We propose to consider graph-theoretic properties as the features of choice for studying the emergence of representations in GNNs. This pipeline aims to probe and interpret the learned representations in GNNs across various architectures and datasets, refining our understanding and trust in these models.}

Typically, in the probabilistic variant of such systems, a neural network first extracts a set of symbols from sub-symbolic input, which are then used by a symbolic component to reason in a probabilistic manner towards answering a query. In this work, we address the problem of formally verifying the robustness of such NeSy probabilistic reasoning systems, therefore paving the way for their safe deployment in critical domains. We analyze the complexity of solving this problem exactly, and show that a decision version of the core computation is $\mathrm{NP}^{\mathrm{PP}}$-complete. In the face of this result, we propose the first approach for approximate, relaxation-based verification of probabilistic NeSy systems. We demonstrate experimentally on a standard NeSy benchmark that the proposed method scales exponentially better than solver-based solutions and apply our technique to a real-world autonomous driving domain, where we verify a safety property under large input dimensionalities.}

The modules guide action policy learning and allow reinforcement learning agents to display behavior consistent with reasoning about the environment. Our experiment is an ablation study performed on the modules. It is conducted in a reinforcement learning environment of a 5x5 grid navigated by an agent that encounters various shapes, each associated with a given reward. The underlying DuelDQN attempts to learn the optimal behavior of the agent in this environment, while the modules facilitate shape recognition and reward prediction. We show that our architecture significantly improves learning, both in terms of performance and the precision of the agent. The modularity of SymDQN allows reflecting on the intricacies and complexities of combining neural and symbolic approaches in reinforcement learning.}

	abstract = {This work presents a neuro-symbolic analysis of the learnability of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in classifying structured formal languages—specifically, **counter languages** and **Dyck languages**, which serve as canonical examples of context-free and mildly context-sensitive grammars. While prior studies have highlighted the expressive power of first-order (LSTM) and second-order (O2RNN) architectures within the Chomsky hierarchy, we challenge this perspective by shifting the focus from theoretical expressivity to *practical learnability under finite precision constraints*. Our results suggest that RNNs function more as finite-state machines than stack-based automata when implemented with realistic training regimes and embedding representations. We show that classification performance degrades sharply as structural similarities between positive and negative sequences increase—highlighting a core limitation in the RNN's ability to internalize hierarchical structure without symbolic scaffolding. Interestingly, even simple linear classifiers built on top of RNN-derived embeddings outperform chance, underscoring the hidden representational capacity within learned states. To probe generalization, we train models on input lengths up to 40 and evaluate on lengths extending to 500, using 10 distinct seeds to measure statistical robustness. O2RNNs consistently demonstrate greater stability and generalization compared to LSTMs, particularly under varied initialization strategies. These findings expose the fragility of learned language representations and emphasize the role of architectural bias, initialization, and data sampling in determining what is truly learnable. Ultimately, our study reframes RNN learnability through the lens of *symbolic structure and computational constraints*, advocating for stronger formal criteria when assessing neural models’ capacity to reason over structured sequences. We argue that expressivity alone is insufficient—**stability, precision, and symbolic alignment** are essential for true neuro-symbolic generalization.}

We train embeddings using triplet loss, which requires examples consisting of an anchor, a positive example, and a negative example. We introduce three ideas: generating anchors that are more likely to have repeated terms, generating positive and negative examples in a way that ensures a good balance between easy, medium, and hard examples, and periodically emphasizing the hardest examples during training. We conduct several experiments to evaluate this approach, including a comparison of different embeddings across different knowledge bases, in an attempt to identify what characteristics make an embedding well-suited to a particular reasoning task.}

language into programming languages like Python or Java. However, for niche computer
languages, where there is limited training data, fine-tuning a base model is often necessary.
A key challenge arises when the pretrained embeddings of natural language terms interfere
with the intended syntax and semantics of formal language terms. This issue is especially
pronounced in the logical language of SUO-KIF, which is used in the Suggested Upper
Merged Ontology (SUMO). SUMO contains thousands of terms that closely resemble everyday
English words. As a result, models often produce syntactic errors or hallucinate
non-existent terms due to conflicting embeddings learned during base training.
This work introduces a tokenization-based technique to mitigate these issues. By altering
how formal terms are tokenized, we can decouple their embeddings from similar
natural language words, significantly reducing syntax errors and term hallucinations in the
generated formal language output.}

However, these methods rely on fragile, implicit mechanisms often yielding inconsistent outputs across seeds, formats, or minor prompt variations making them fundamentally unreliable for tasks requiring stable, interpretable reasoning. In contrast, automata-based neuro-symbolic frameworks like RetoMaton offer a more structured and trustworthy alternative by grounding retrieval in symbolic memory with deterministic transitions. In this work, we extend RetoMaton by replacing its global datastore with a local, task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA), constructed directly from external domain corpora. This local automaton structure promotes robust, context-aware retrieval while preserving symbolic traceability and low inference overhead. Unlike prompting, which entangles context and memory in opaque ways, our approach leverages the explicit structure of WFAs to provide verifiable and modular retrieval behavior, making it better suited for domain transfer and interoperability. We evaluate this local RetoMaton variant on two pretrained LLMs LLaMA-3.2-1B and Gemma-3-1B-PT across three reasoning tasks: TriviaQA (reading comprehension), GSM8K (multi-step math), and MMLU (domain knowledge). Compared to the base model and prompting-based methods, augmenting these setups with local RetoMaton consistently improves performance while enabling transparent and reproducible retrieval dynamics. Our results highlight a promising shift toward trustworthy, symbolic reasoning in modern LLMs via lightweight, automaton-guided memory.}

This paper introduces a framework that leverages pretrained LLMs to generate Description Logic (DL) class expressions from instance-level examples and background knowledge, translated to natural language. The baseline is Concept Induction, a symbolic learning approach that is mostly based on formal logical reasoning over a DL theory. Drawing inspiration from the DL-Learner architecture, our approach replaces traditional symbolic methods with LLM-based models to generate DL class expressions from instance-level data. 

We evaluate our approach using three benchmark ontologies across two LLMs: gpt-4o and o3-mini. We use a symbolic reasoner, Pellet, to verify the LLM-generated results and incorporate the reasoner’s feedback into our pipeline to ensure logical consistency, thereby generating a hybrid neurosymbolic system. By introducing controlled variations to the background knowledge, we assess the models’ reliance on commonsense versus formal reasoning. Results show that o3-mini achieves near-perfect accuracy across settings, albeit with longer runtime. These findings demonstrate that LLMs have the potential to serve as scalable and flexible DL learners when coupled in a hybrid neurosymbolic setting, offering a promising alternative to symbolic approaches—particularly in contexts where high-quality ontologies are incomplete or unavailable.}

In this paper, we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification to leverage  problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - $\textit{DeepProbLog}$, $\textit{Scallop}$, and $\textit{DomiKnowS}$. We identify the challenges within each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this problem in novel ways.}

However, current neural architectures are not capable of symbolic manipulation, which is thought to be a hallmark of human intelligence. Vector-symbolic architectures (VSAs) promise to bring this ability through simple vector manipulation, highly amenable to current and emerging hardware and software stacks built for their neural counterparts. Integrating the two models into the paradigm of neuro-vector-symbolic architectures may achieve even more human-like performance. However, despite ongoing efforts, there are no clear guidelines on the deployment of VSA in deep learning-based training situations. In this work, we aim to begin providing such guidelines by offering four practical lessons we have observed through the analysis of many VSA models and implementations. We provide thorough benchmarks and results that corroborate such lessons. First, we observe that Multiply-add-permute (MAP) and Hadamard linear binding (HLB) are up to 3-4$\times$ faster than holographic reduced representations (HRR), even when the latter is equipped with optimized FFT-based convolutions. Second, we propose further speed improvements by replacing similarity search with a linear readout, with no effect on retrieval. Third, we analyze the retrieval performance of MAP, HRR and HLB in a noise-free and noisy scenario to simulate processing by a neural network, and show that they are equivalent. Finally, we implement a hierarchical multi-level composition scheme, with notable benefits to the flexibility of integration of VSAs inside existing neural architectures. Overall, we show that these four lessons lead to faster and more effective deployment of VSA.}

In this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular the representations are with respect to the concept.

Instead, we aim at directly injecting the temporal knowledge into the neural model without having to rely on a separate symbolic structure. Specifically, we propose a neurosymbolic framework designed to incorporate temporal logic specifications, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf), directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks. We extend the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm, leveraging the recent introduction of fuzzy LTLf interpretations. We name this proposed method Temporal Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR).

This bidirectional interface preserves the combinatorial efficiency and explainability of symbolic reasoning without sacrificing the adaptability of deep sequence models, and it permits a principled analysis that tracks how approximation errors from both planning and execution accumulate across the hierarchy. Empirical studies in stochastic grid-world domains demonstrate that the proposed method consistently surpasses purely symbolic, purely neural, and existing hierarchical baselines in both success and efficiency, highlighting its robustness for sequential tasks.}

There is, however, scepticism in the NeSy community around the scenarios in which the independence assumption actually limits NeSy systems (Faronius and Dos Martires, 2025). In this work, we settle this question by formally showing that assuming independence among symbolic concepts entails that a model can never represent uncertainty over certain concept combinations. Thus, the model fails to be aware of _reasoning shortcuts_, i.e., the pathological behaviour of NeSy predictors that predict correct downstream tasks but for the wrong reasons.}

Techniques where ontological concepts are interpreted as boxes have shown to be particularly useful in this context, as they are both suitably expressive and of low computational complexity. However, to use those regularities for learning, it is necessary to determine and understand the possible biases in the approach: how do we distinguish what is learned due to regularities in the data from what is simply based on the representational limitations of the embedding? In this paper, we establish that there are some severe limitations in expressivity when modeling description logic ontologies with box embeddings in intended target languages such as $\mathcal{ELHO}(\circ)^\bot$. We illustrate that, under some weak assumptions, box semantics always satisfy Helly's Property, and is thus too weak to capture semantically $\mathcal{ELHO}(\circ)^\bot$ in an adequate way.  We then characterize how so-called Helly-satisfiable $\mathcal{ELHO}(\circ)^\bot$ ontologies can be adequately determined. We discuss the implications of this result with respect to existing box embedding approaches and real-world use cases.}

These axioms abstract away from system-specific details and instead characterize the structural interface between neural perception and symbolic reasoning. Rather than introducing a new method, this work offers a foundation to organize, compare, and reason about the rapidly expanding space of NeSy approaches.}

Functional correctness of generated programs is assessed through functional verification, and adherence to non-functional requirements is evaluated using an industrial static analyzer, along with human evaluation. The results demonstrate that it is feasible for LLMs to generate functionally correct code, with success rates of 540/800, 59/800, and 46/800 for the three modules. Additionally, the generated programs frequently adhere to the defined non-functional requirements. In the cases where the LLM-generated programs did not adhere to the non-functional requirements, deviations typically involve violations of single-read and single-write access patterns or minimal variable scope constraints.

To retrieve information from the text corpus we implement a traditional vector store RAG as well as state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) based approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the relevant subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel ontology-based framework for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT directly which leverages the underlying schema of GDELT to create structured representations of global events. 
For retrieving relevant information from the ontology-based KGs  we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art graph retrieval approaches.
We compare the performance of each method in a question-answering task. We find that while our ontology-based KGs are valuable for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant subgraphs is challenging.

We propose that the formal robustness properties be applied to social choice modelling. We outline how robustness properties can help validate the formation of stable social preference clusters in deep neural network classifiers. Our initial results highlight the vulnerabilities of models in moral-critical scenarios to perturbations, suggesting a verification-training loop for improved robustness. We position this work as an inquiry into the viability of verifying moral preference alignment, based on our initial results. Ultimately, we aim to contribute to the broader interdisciplinary effort that integrates formal methods, social choice theory, and empirical moral psychology for interpretable computational ethics.}

	abstract = {General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models (LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network, performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design, model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.}

However, their performance is degraded by the thresholding of the post-training symbolic translation process. We show here that part of the performance degradation during translation is due to its failure to disentangle the learned knowledge represented in the form of the networks' weights. We address this issue by proposing a new disentanglement method; by splitting nodes that encode nested rules into smaller independent nodes, we are able to better preserve the models' performance. Through experiments on binary, multiclass, and multilabel classification tasks (including those requiring predicate invention), we demonstrate that our disentanglement method provides compact and interpretable logical representations for the neural DNF-based models, with performance closer to that of their pre-translation counterparts.

At the same time, Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models used for this task produce unnormalised scores, making it unclear how to interpret their belief in the truthfulness of triples across different queries. Together, these two factors create a blind spot: models can achieve perfect rankings while assigning scores that are not comparable across queries, limiting their utility in downstream tasks or even in identifying the most plausible triples overall. Indeed, this issue becomes clear when test triples are ranked globally and evaluated with IR metrics, revealing that models with unnormalized scores often perform poorly due to inconsistent scoring across queries. To address this problem, we propose a new KGE model, called ART, which exploits probabilistic Auto-Regressive modelling and hence is normalised by design. Despite its conceptual simplicity, we show that ART outperforms prior art for discriminative and generative LP as well as other post-hoc calibration techniques.}

By combining linguistic and structural query properties with system load metrics, SymRAG allocates resources proportional to reasoning requirements. Evaluated on 2,000 queries across HotpotQA (multi-hop reasoning) and DROP (discrete reasoning) using Llama-3.2-3B and Mistral-7B models, SymRAG achieves competitive accuracy (97.6--100.0\% exact match) with efficient resource utilization (3.6--6.2% CPU utilization, 0.985--3.165s processing). Disabling adaptive routing increases processing time by 169--1151%, showing its significance for complex models.

It extracts rules from this neural representation by exploiting the model’s reconstruction mechanism. Extensive evaluations on five datasets against seven baselines demonstrate that Aerial+ achieves state-of-the-art results by learning more concise, high-quality rule sets with full data coverage.

Instead of directly predicting avatar parameters, our approach uses a neural network to predict semantic tags (hair length, curliness, direction) as an intermediate symbolic representation, then applies symbolic search algorithms to match optimal avatar assets. This neurosymbolic design produces higher annotator agreements (96.7\% vs 31.0\% for direct annotation), enables more consistent model predictions, and provides interpretable avatar selection with ranked alternatives. The tag-based system generalizes easily across rendering systems, requiring only new asset annotation while reusing human image tags. Experimental results demonstrate superior convergence, consistency, and visual quality compared to direct prediction methods, showing how neurosymbolic approaches can improve trustworthiness and interpretability in creative AI applications.}

These robots must perceive complex and dynamic surroundings, understand tasks, and execute context-appropriate actions. However, current systems typically rely on proprietary, hard-coded solutions tied to specific hardware and software, resulting in siloed implementations that are difficult to adapt and scale across platforms. Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution to enable interoperability across systems, through structured and standardized representations of knowledge and reasoning. However, symbolic systems such as KGs and ontologies struggle with raw and noisy sensory input. In contrast, multimodal language models are well suited for interpreting input such as images and natural language, but often lack transparency, consistency, and knowledge grounding. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic framework that combines the perceptual strengths of multimodal language models with the structured representations provided by KGs and ontologies, with the aim of supporting interoperability in robotic applications. Our approach generates ontology-compliant KGs that can inform robot behavior in a platform-independent manner. We evaluated this framework by integrating robot perception data, ontologies, and five multimodal models (three LLaMA-based and two GPT-based models), each using different modes of neural-symbolic interaction. We assess the consistency and effectiveness of the generated KGs across multiple runs and configurations, and perform statistical analyzes to evaluate performance. Results show that GPT-o1 and LLaMA 4 Maverick consistently outperform other models. However, our findings also indicate that newer models do not guarantee better results, highlighting the critical role of the integration strategy in generating ontology-compliant KGs.}

To benefit from both worlds, we propose JARVIS, a neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework for modular, generalizable, and interpretable conversational embodied agents. First, it acquires symbolic representations by prompting large language models (LLMs) for language understanding and sub-goal planning, and by constructing semantic maps from visual observations. Then the symbolic module reasons for sub-goal planning and action generation based on task- and action-level common sense. Extensive experiments on the TEACh dataset validate the efficacy and efficiency of our JARVIS framework, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all three dialog-based embodied tasks, including Execution from Dialog History (EDH), Trajectory from Dialog (TfD), and Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC) (e.g., our method boosts the unseen Success Rate on EDH from 6.1\% to 15.8\%). Moreover, we systematically analyze the essential factors that affect the task performance and also demonstrate the superiority of our method in few-shot settings.}

Indeed, modern KGEs encompass different inductive biases, which can account for relational patterns like reasoning compositional chains, symmetries, anti-symmetries, hierarchical patterns, etc.
However, KGE models inherently lack interpretability, as their generalization capabilities are purely focused on mapping human interpretable units of information, like constants and predicates, into vector embeddings in a dense latent space, which is completely opaque to a human operator. 
On the other hand, different Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods have shown competitive results in knowledge completion tasks, but their focus on achieving high accuracy often leads to sacrificing interpretability. Many existing NeSy approaches, while inherently interpretable, resort to blending their predictions with opaque KGEs to boost performance, ultimately diminishing their explanatory power.
This paper introduces a novel approach to address this limitation by applying a post-hoc NeSy method to KGE models. This strategy ensures both high fidelity to KGE models and the inherent interpretability of NeSy approaches. The proposed framework defines NeSy reasoners that generate explicit logic proofs using predefined or learned rules, ensuring transparent and explainable predictions. We evaluate the methodology using both accuracy and explainability-based metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.}

To assess the influence of visual uncertainties on these symbolic analogical reasoning tests, we extend the I-RAVEN-X dataset, which otherwise assumes an oracle perception.
We adopt a two-fold strategy to simulate this imperfect visual perception: 1) we introduce confounding attributes which, being sampled at random, do not contribute to the prediction of the correct answer of the puzzles, and 2) smooth the distributions of the input attributes' values. 
We observe a sharp decline in OpenAI's o3-mini task accuracy, dropping from 86.6% on the original I-RAVEN to just 17.0%—approaching random chance—on the more challenging I-RAVEN-X, which increases input length and range and emulates perceptual uncertainty.
This drop occurred despite spending 3.4x more reasoning tokens.
A similar trend is also observed for DeepSeek R1: from 80.6% to 23.2%.

Our framework includes 3 components: generating natural language statements of the code to be verified, an LLM that generates formal proofs for the given statement, and a module employing heuristics for building the final proof. To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage fine-tuning process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model to generate syntactically correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that encourages the model to generate proofs verified by a theorem prover. We validate our framework using the miniF2F-test benchmark and the Isabelle proof assistant and design a use case to verify the correctness of the AWS S3 bucket access policy code.

From the class hierarchies in the ontologies, box embeddings are learnt as low dimensional representations of the nodes in the graph, which are used together with GNNs to predict cell growth for digenic deletions from the KG. With this we show that high level qualitative information can be used to predict experimental data.

Prediction performance was improved when using box embeddings of ontologies to represent the nodes in the graph, compared to learning features specific for this task. This suggests that class hierarchies in ontologies contain useful information about the domains, which can be extracted in the training of the box embeddings. We also demonstrate that our model can generalise beyond the task it was trained for by evaluating it on higher order gene deletions.

Additionally, we apply model interpretability techniques to identify co-occurring edges critical for fitness. Our findings are further validated by a biological experiment that reveals an association between inositol utilization and osmotic stress resistance, emphasising the model’s potential to guide scientific discovery.}

a symbolic system based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) that infers first-order constraints which are human-interpretable and generalise across environment configurations; and a neural system based on Deep Q learning (DQL) that efficiently learns near-optimal policies subject to those constraints. By weighting the high-level ILP constraints (based on the order in which they are learnt) and encoding them as low-level state-action penalties in the DQL reward function, we effectively allow earlier constraints to be overridden by later ones. Unlike prior work in ICRL, our approach is able to continue working when exposed to newly encountered expert behaviours that reveal more nuanced exceptions to previously learnt constraints. We evaluate NSICRL in a simulated traffic domain, which shows how it outperforms existing methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy when learning hard constraints; and which also shows the utility of learning defeasible norms in an ICRL context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that places equal emphasis on exploratory and imitative learning while also being able to infer defeasible norms in an interpretable way that scales to non-trivial examples.}

	abstract = {Machine learning models increasingly influence decisions in high-stakes settings such as
finance, law and hiring, driving the need for transparent, interpretable outcomes. However, while explainable approaches can help understand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the underlying proprietary algorithm—an undesirable outcome for many practitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency with a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers actionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained.

Counterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by showing
how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We propose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a novel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual methods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model using an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used to generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original underlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding the “effort” associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to causal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides a more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a favourable outcome. 

We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and actionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all while having a lower cost. Our findings highlight MC3G’s potential to enhance transparency, accountability, and practical utility in decision-making processes that incorporate machine-learning approaches.}

	abstract = {This paper examines the impact of neurosymbolic learning on sequence analysis in Structured Probability Spaces (SPS), comparing its effectiveness against a purely neural approach. Sequence analysis in SPS is challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of states and the difficulty of obtaining sufficient annotated training samples. Additionally, in SPS, the set of realizations with non-zero support is often a scattered, non-trivial subset of the Cartesian product of variables, adding complexity to learning and inference. The problem of sequence analysis in SPS emerges, for example, in reconstructing the activities of goal-directed agents from noisy and ambiguous sensor data. We explore the potential of neurosymbolic methods, which integrate symbolic background knowledge with neural learning, to constrain the hypothesis space and improve learning efficiency. Specifically, we conduct a simulation study in human activity recognition using DeepProbLog as a representative for neurosymbolic learning. Our results demonstrate that incorporating symbolic knowledge improves sample efficiency, generalization, and zero-shot learning, compared to a purely neural approach. Furthermore, we show that neurosymbolic models maintain robust performance under data scarcity while offering enhanced interpretability and stability. These findings suggest that neurosymbolic learning provides a promising foundation for sequence analysis in complex, structured domains, where purely neural approaches struggle with insufficient training data and limited generalization ability.}

Within this framework, we investigate and develop novel learning and reasoning approaches that preserve structural similarities to traditional learning and reasoning paradigms. Comprehensive evaluations across complex mathematical reasoning procedures of varying difficulties provide insights into the effectiveness of our approach towards learning efficiency and reasoning reliability.}

To enhance adaptability and reduce training overhead, we address VQA in a zero-shot setting by leveraging pre-trained neural modules without additional fine-tuning. Our proposed hybrid neurosymbolic framework, whose capabilities are demonstrated on the challenging GQA dataset, integrates neural and symbolic components through logic-based reasoning via Answer-Set Programming. Specifically, our pipeline employs large language models for semantic parsing of input questions, followed by the generation of a scene graph that captures relevant visual content. Interpretable rules then operate on the symbolic representations of both the question and the scene graph to derive an answer. Our framework provides a key advantage: it enables full transparency into the reasoning process. Using an existing explanation tool, we illustrate how our method fosters trust by making decisions interpretable and facilitates error analysis when predictions are incorrect. Beyond explaining its own reasoning, our framework can also explain answers from more opaque models by integrating their answers into our system, enabling broader interpretability in VQA.}

The DL models are used to detect objects and estimate their depth in a set of labeled images. The obtained outputs are employed to form a dataset of instances characterizing the possible classes. Subsequently, a multi-valued mapping is defined between the data instances and the considered images resulting into each image being represented by the set of instances associated with it. The obtained mapping is utilized to infer necessity and possibility conditions of each class, or equivalently its upper (plausibility) and lower (belief) probabilities. Based on these interval evaluations, a rule-based and a score-based classifiers are built. The overall method is explainable and directly interpretable, robust to data scarcity and data imbalance. The presented framework is studied and evaluated on an abandoned bag detection use case.}

Here, neurosymbolic models offer a valuable opportunity, as they allow the specification of symbolic, logical constraints that are often guaranteed to be satisfied. However, research on neurosymbolic applications to algorithmic fairness is still in an early stage. With our work, we bridge this gap by integrating counterfactual fairness into the neurosymbolic framework of Logic Tensor Networks (LTN). We use LTN to express accuracy and counterfactual fairness constraints in first-order logic and employ them to achieve desirable levels of both performance and fairness at training time. Our approach is agnostic to the underlying causal model and data generation technique; as such, it may be easily integrated into existing pipelines that generate and extract counterfactual examples. We show, through concrete examples on three real-world datasets, that logical reasoning about counterfactual fairness has some important advantages, among which its intrinsic interpretability, and its flexibility in handling subgroup fairness. Compared to three recent methodologies in counterfactual fairness, our experiments show that a neurosymbolic, LTN-based approach attains better levels of counterfactual fairness.}

Such macro-actions are learnt via Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) from a few traces of execution (belief-action pairs), thus eliminating the need for manually designed heuristics and requiring only the specification of the POMDP transition model. In the Pocman and Rocksample benchmark scenarios, our learned macro-actions demonstrate increased expressiveness and generality when compared to time-independent heuristics, indeed offering substantial computational efficiency improvements.}

Cases attack or support those with opposing or agreeing labellings, with the strength of each argument and relationship learned through gradient-based methods. This argumentation debate structure provides human-aligned reasoning, improving model interpretability compared to traditional neural networks (NNs). Unlike the existing purely symbolic variant, Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (AA-CBR), Gradual AA-CBR is capable of multi-class classification, automatic learning of feature and data point importance, assigning uncertainty values to outcomes, using all available data points, and does not require binary features.

Clean-up typically compares noisy vectors against a "codebook" of prototype vectors, incurring computational complexity that is quadratic or similar.  We present a new codebook representation that supports efficient clean-up, based on Kroneker products of rotation-like matrices.  The resulting clean-up time complexity is linearithmic, i.e. $\mathcal{O}(N\text{log}N)$, where $N$ is the vector dimension and also the number of vectors in the codebook.  Clean-up space complexity  is $\mathcal{O}(N)$.  Furthermore, the codebook is not stored explicitly in computer memory: It can be represented in $\mathcal{O}(\text{log}N)$ space, and individual vectors in the codebook can be materialized in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time.  At the same time, asymptotic memory capacity remains comparable to standard approaches. Computer experiments confirm these results, demonstrating several orders of magnitude more scalability than baseline VSA techniques.}
